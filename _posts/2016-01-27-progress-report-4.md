***Note:** Progress reports will be trimmed back for a while to assess the importance of the extra details in the original reports. If you want those details back, ask for them in an email or on social media.*

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, reflecting on *[Failure][2]* (and what was learned from it), giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully you will find these progress reports informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. [Cuts and Convos][8] was spotlighted.
2. Interviewed two amazing charities!
3. Started Giving Jar business formation.
4. Attended Rotary Club meeting as a guest.

## Failure {#failure}

There are almost always setbacks when working on a project of any size. Here are the lessons learned from the last round of setbacks:

1. Scheduling blog posts on a static site is a headache!
2. Local charity news gets more attention than national news.
3. Need to spend more time learning about marketing.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Many thanks to Jonathan Arias of [Cuts and Convos][9]. The conversations are always great with this guy!

Thank you, Monica, for the impromptu interview for [Creating Heroes Stephen's Way][10] last week!

Amy and Lysne also took the time to meet and give an interview for [Helping Women Period][11]. Thank you!
