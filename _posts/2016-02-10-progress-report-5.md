Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, reflecting on *[Failure][2]* (and what was learned from it), giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully you will find these progress reports informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Creating Heroes Stephen's Way][8].
2. Giving Jar is officially an LLC!
3. Wrote next spotlight.
4. Blog changes are automatically published to a test site.

## Failure {#failure}

There are almost always setbacks when working on a project of any size. Here are the lessons learned from the last round of setbacks:

1. *Send* and *Save Draft* do not mean the same thing.
