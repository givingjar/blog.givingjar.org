Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, reflecting on *[Failure][2]* (and what was learned from it), giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully you will find these progress reports informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Helping Women Period][8].
2. Interviewed [Firecracker Foundation][9].
3. Wrote next spotlight.
4. Provided local tech support for GitHub's Jekyll 3 migration.

## Failure {#failure}

There are almost always setbacks when working on a project of any size. Here are the lessons learned from the last round of setbacks:

1. Feeling overwhelmed should trigger an evaluation of priorities. 
2. Another big dive into spotlights is needed to free up room for writing software.
