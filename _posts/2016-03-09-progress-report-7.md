    After several road bumps, spotlights can now be scheduled to appear on a
    specific day! Read about that and other successes, lessons learned, who
    helped, and what's coming soon in this new progress report.

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, reflecting on *[Failure][2]* (and what was learned from it), giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully you will find these progress reports informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlights automatically appear on the day they are scheduled!
2. Spotlighted [Firecracker Foundation][8].
3. Interviewed [Happendance][9].
4. Created VM where code can be hosted.

## Failure {#failure}

There are almost always setbacks when working on a project of any size. Here are the lessons learned from the last round of setbacks:

1. When working with new tech, expect problems and seek help from experts.
2. Not all problems are solvable. Sometimes you have to settle for a workaround.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to Missy for introducing me to new charitiesÂ and sharing the Happendance story!

Much appreciation goes to the Surge.sh and Jekyll communities for helping confirms issues in their software.

Thank you to all of the new friends on social media:

* 17 mailing list members (+1)
* 32 Twitter followers (+4)
* 50 Facebook page likes (-0)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Spotlight [Happendance][9].
* Find new charities to interview.
* Start building an API.

As always, Giving Jar is looking for charities to interview. If you know a charity that might be interested, [send an email][5], [tweet][6], or write on the [Facebook][7] wall.
