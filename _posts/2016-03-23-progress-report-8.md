    Marketing is not an easy discipline to learn, especially from books. Getting
    out there and learning from people, asking questions, trying, failing, and
    trying again, measuring results, and so much more are needed to promote a
    business or product. Read about that and other successes, lessons learned,
    who helped, and what's coming soon in this new progress report.

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, reflecting on *[Failure][2]* (and what was learned from it), giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully you will find these progress reports informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Happendance][8].
2. Attended Marketing Bootcamp.
3. [Explained][10] scheduling static site content.

## Failure {#failure}

Setbacks are bound to happen no matter the size of the project. Here are the lessons learned from the last round of setbacks:

1. Analyzing new software can take up as much time as you let it.
2. Word of mouth networking is important for local businesses.  

## Thanks {#thanks}

[LEAP][11] organized an amazing and affordable Branding and Marketing Bootcamp.

Thank you to all of the new friends on social media:

* 17 mailing list members (-0)
* 35 Twitter followers (+3)
* 54 Facebook page likes (+4)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Interview [Lansing Art Gallery][9].
* Schedule two more interviews.
* Compare Express.js and Ruby on Rails.

As always, Giving Jar is looking for charities to interview. If you know a charity that might be interested, [send an email][5], [tweet][6], or write on the [Facebook][7] wall.
