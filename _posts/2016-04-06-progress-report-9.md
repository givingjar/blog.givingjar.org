    Giving Jar officially changed gears to focus exclusively on Michigan charity
    news in all published content. Read about that and other successes, lessons
    learned, who helped, and what's coming soon in this new progress report.

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, reflecting on *[Failure][2]* (and what was learned from it), giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully you will find these progress reports informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Lansing Art Gallery][8].
2. Interviewed [Lansing Promise][9].
3. Scheduled four more interviews!
4. Switched to Michigan charity news.

## Failure {#failure}

Setbacks are bound to happen no matter the size of the project. Here are the lessons learned from the last round of setbacks:

* There is an art to identifying the moment when a face-to-face meeting will save more time than a long email exchange.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to Barb Whitney and Justin Sheehan for the interviews and Ian Kast for the photos. Many tips and referrals were sent our way. It's all very much appreciated!

Thank you to all of our new friends on social media:

* 18 mailing list members (+1)
* 45 Twitter followers (+10)
* 56 Facebook page likes (+2)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Interview [Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame][10].
* Interview [Allen Neighborhood Center][11].
* First meeting with the [Lansing Regional Chamber][12].
* Write Express.js and Ruby on Rails comparison.

As always, Giving Jar is looking for charities to interview. If you know a charity that might be interested, [send an email][5], [tweet][6], or write on the [Facebook][7] wall.
