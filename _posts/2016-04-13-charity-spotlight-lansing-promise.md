The [Lansing Promise][1] expands appreciation for the visual arts by providing a permanent location for art exhibits and educational programs that are open to the public. The gallery also promotes Michigan artists and craftspeople by providing a place where their works can be purchased.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of the Lansing Promise, Justin Sheehan.

## Origin Story

## Today

The Lansing Promise has two similar scholarship opportunities for students.

## Big Wins

Between 2012 and 2016, 425 students have used the Lansing Promise. Of those, 86% who studied at MSU have stayed with the program. Similarly, 74% who attended LCC stayed with it. The Lansing Promise has also awarded $400,000 in scholarships this year.

Beyond the numbers, there have also been several important partnerships established to raise awareness of the Lansing Promise to students, parents, and advisors. Regularly spreading the word about the scholarships at school events will go a long way to help more students pursue post-secondary education.

## Goals

The Lansing Promise hopes to increase college and career attainment for *every* person in Lansing. More broadly, Justin wants to help kids succeed by giving them the hope and confidence they need to grow. In order to achieve these goals, students and their parents need to know the Lansing Promise exists and it needs to be approachable.

## For Nonprofits

If you are considering starting your own nonprofit, Justin recommends starting with some research. Try to first identify a problem or need that is not already being met and figure out how you can help.

Part of your research should also include comparing what you want to do with other nonprofits that are trying to satisfy the same need and deciding if it makes more sense to join forces with someone else before starting something new.

## For Volunteers

Research is important when you want to volunteer your time or donate. Even if it's a simple charity search on [GuideStar][3], make sure you have a basic understanding of an organization and do a gut check before you commit yourself or your money to them.
