Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully you will find these progress reports informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Lansing Promise][8].
2. Interviewed [Michigan Women's Historical Center][9] and [Allen Neighborhood Center][10].
3. Finished Express vs. Rails comparison.

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Proofreading while writing is a waste of time. Write first, then proofread.
* Word of mouth referrals go a long way when your business is locally-focused!

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to Emily Fijol and Joan Nelson for the interviews. We got lots of referrals and compliments about the blog. Thanks for the love! <3

Thank you to all of our new friends on social media:

* 20 mailing list members (+2)
* 45 Twitter followers (+0)
* 57 Facebook page likes (+1)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Spotlight [Michigan Women's Historical Center][10].
* Design and start writing some software!

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
