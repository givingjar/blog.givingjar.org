    Last week there was an exciting coffee break with Paul Schmidt of UnoDeuce
    Multimedia where we talked about working together to better promote Lansing
    nonprofits and charities! Read about that and other successes, lessons
    learned, who helped, and what's coming soon in this new progress report.

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully you will find these progress reports informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Michigan Women's Historical Center][8].
2. Wrote [Allen Neighborhood Center][9] spotlight.
3. Discussed partnership with [UnoDeuce Multimedia][10].
4. Designed business cards.

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* It takes effort to keep meetings on track and on schedule. Is there tech out there for this?
* When you need to make a decision, keep the number of choices low to avoid taking overanalyzing.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to Paul Schmidt of UnoDeuce for reaching out about a partnership. Looking forward to working with someone who also wants to see Lansing's charities thrive!

Thank you to all of our new friends on social media:

* 20 mailing list members (-0)
* 49 Twitter followers (+4)
* 59 Facebook page likes (+2)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Spotlight [Allen Neighborhood Center][9].
* Design a RESTish account management API.
* Schedule more interviews.

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
