[Allen Neighborhood Center][1] is rejuvenating Lansing's Eastside by identifying pain points within the community and introducing programs to address their needs. By directly involving residents, the center helps build a strong, united, and sustainable neighborhood.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Director of Allen Neighborhood Center, Joan Nelson.

## Origin Story

## For Nonprofits

While growing Allen Neighborhood Center, Joan has experienced a cycle that works really well. First, find your stakeholders and make a plan with them. Then, gather funds and implement that plan. Repeating this process will keep your stakeholders engaged and let your organization adjust to their needs.

## Big Wins

In 2004 the center was able to associate food insecurity with a lack of transportation amongst many of the residents. The Allen Farmers Market was created to provide access to healthy foods within walking distance of the neighborhood.

The following year, they became the first nonprofit market to accept food stamps. Allen Neighborhood Center has many examples of quickly identifying community needs and introducing programs to address them.

According to Joan, successfully growing and sustaining a wide variety of programs is one of the center's greatest accomplishments.

## Goals

The center has can clearly sustain their current programs, but Joan would like to see these programs strengthened. At a broad level this includes growing leadership, acquiring new technology and hardware to improve operations, and improving volunteer recruitment.

Individual programs have opportunities to offer more as well. For example, accessibility of the market could be improved by introducing satellite locations throughout the neighborhood.

## For Volunteers and Donors

Whether you choose to donate your time or your money to a charity, think of your donation as an investment. The help you provide will be amplified by the number of lives you touch and the energy you invested will come back to you.
