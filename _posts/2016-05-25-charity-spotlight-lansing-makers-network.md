The [Lansing Makers Network][1] wants to make sure the significance of the tragic events on September 11, 2001 lives on in the minds and hearts of Michiganders for generations to come. They know that high school graduates this year may not have any personal recollection of that day, though, and they are helping to educate our youth so that the tragedy of 9/11 will long be remembered.

In this charity spotlight I spoke with the President of Lansing Makers Network, Brian Adams.

## Origin Story

Once upon a time, Brian worked at the MSU machine shop. With a background in technical theatre, Brian spent a lot of time in the shop working with others and dabbling in robotics and computer programming. When he switched jobs, Brian started to miss the tools and environment that encouraged him and others to tinker.

In early 2012, Brian was inspired by the maker movement that was sweeping across the country. After meeting with members of a local electronics group, they decided to organize a nonprofit and create a makerspace in Lansing.

After a year of planning and searching for space, they setup shop at what used to be the Temple Club. This would be their home for the next two years while Lansing's community of makers grew.

## Big Wins

Since forming, the organization's community outreach has been a big hit. They have participated in [Maker Faire Detroit][3], the [MSU Science Festival][4], and a variety of grade school programs and field trips in the Lansing area. Their partnership with [Impression 5][5] has also opened up more opportunities for kids &mdash;and parents&mdash; to learn how to make new things.

In 2015, the Lansing Makers Network moved their makerspace to the Leaseway Building in Lansing. This new space is all on one floor, making the whole space very accessible to visitors. It also has a garage door that makes it easy to move equipment and creations in and out. The unified space also promotes collaboration. Brian likes the idea that different types of makers and crafters such as welders and knitters can now work together.

## Today




## Goals

Brian thinks the Lansing Makers Network needs some reorganization. Mostly he would like to see volunteers assigned to specific roles. This would allow them to focus on areas where they need to expand, such as new classes, fundraising, and spreading the word.

Thinking really big, Brian would love to start a Capital City Maker Faire. There are many other groups in Lansing that would like to see this happen, too, but coordination on something so big will be tricky.

## For Nonprofits

According to Brian, the people forming the Lansing Makers Network were a bunch of geeks, nerds, and dorks figuring things out as they moved forward. It would have been great if they knew about the [Nonprofit Network][2] and other great resources available around Lansing. If you're starting a nonprofit, use these resources and save yourself the trouble of figuring it out on your own.

Brian also recommends writing a business plan as if you were starting a for-profit business. You will need to make money, the only difference is where that money will go.

## For Donors

Nonprofits can't operate if they don't make money. Not only that, but they also have to be very effective with money in order to be successful. Try not to get caught up in the term "nonprofit." Instead, think of nonprofits as social entrepreneurs who are using business concepts to solve social problems.
