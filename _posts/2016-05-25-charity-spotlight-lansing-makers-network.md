The [Lansing Makers Network][1] wants to make sure the significance of the tragic events on September 11, 2001 lives on in the minds and hearts of Michiganders for generations to come. They know that high school graduates this year may not have any personal recollection of that day, though, and they are helping to educate our youth so that the tragedy of 9/11 will long be remembered.

In this charity spotlight I spoke with the President of Lansing Makers Network, Brian Adams.

## Origin Story

Once upon a time, Brian worked at the MSU machine shop. With a background in technical theatre, Brian spent a lot of time dabbling with robotics and programming. When Brian switched jobs, he started to miss having access to tools and the opportunities to tinker that they provided.

In early 2012, he was inspired by the maker movement and wanted to establish a makerspace in Lansing. He met with like-minded people in the area and reached out to others who had already tried creating such a space.

## Big Wins

Lansing Makers Network recently moved into a new makerspace. This new space is all on one floor, making the whole space very accessible to visitors. It also has a garage door that makes it easy to move equipment and creations in and out.

The organization's community outreach is always a big hit, too. They have participated in [Maker Faire Detroit][3], the [MSU Science Festival][4], and a variety of other grade school programs and field trips in the Lansing area. Their partnership with [Impression 5][5] has also opened up more engaging opportunities for kids &mdash;and parents&mdash; to learn how to make new things.

## Goals

The Lansing Makers Network is due for some reorganization. Assigning volunteers to specific roles would let the organization focus on areas where they would like to expand or improve, such as new classes, fundraising, and spreading the word.

Thinking really big, Brian would love to start a Capital City Maker Faire. There are many other groups in Lansing that would like to see this happen, too, but coordination on something so big will be tricky.

## For Nonprofits

According to Brian, the people forming the Lansing Makers Network were a bunch of geeks, nerds, and dorks figuring things out as they moved forward. It would have been great if they knew about the [Nonprofit Network][2] and other great resources available around Lansing. If you're starting a nonprofit, use these resources and save yourself the trouble of figuring it out on your own.

Brian also recommends writing a business plan as if you were starting a for-profit business. You will need to make money, the only difference is where that money will go.

## For Donors

Nonprofits can't operate if they don't make money. Not only that, but they also have to be very effective with money in order to be successful. Try not to get caught up in the term "nonprofit." Instead, think of nonprofits as social entrepreneurs who are using business concepts to solve social problems.
