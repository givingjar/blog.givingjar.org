Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully, you will find this progress report informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Lansing Makers Network][8].
2. Interviewed [Joshua's Place][9] and [Williamston Theatre][10].
3. First steps to creating the Giving Jar charity!

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Find ways to get into a flow when writing doesn't come easily.
* You only get so much willpower and focus each day.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to Bob Worgul and Emily Sutton-Smith for sharing your stories and to [Klein Allison][11] for the pro tips about starting a 501(c)(3) nonprofit!

Thank you to all of our new friends on social media:

* 20 mailing list members (-0)
* 56 Twitter followers (+4)
* 71 Facebook page likes (+4)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Spotlight [Joshua's Place][9].
* Do all the filings, research, and writing needed to start a nonprofit.

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
