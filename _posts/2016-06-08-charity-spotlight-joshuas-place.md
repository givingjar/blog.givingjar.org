In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Founder of Joshua's Place, Bob Worgul.

## Today



## Goals

Bob already has plans to expand Joshua's Place. In fact, the building has been designed with expansion in mind and can be easily built out to accommodate up to fourteen residents! The additional space and staff would also allow Joshua's Place to care for women with developmental disabilities.

## For Nonprofits

If you want to do something to help a loved one, see what's already available before trying to build something of your own. If you don't find a perfect fit somewhere else, look at ways to get support from organizations that offer services you will need.

Food banks, health foundations, and clothing donation services are just a few examples of charities that you can collaborate with. Let them do what they're best at for you so you can focus on your mission.

## For Volunteers

Many charities like to add fun, bonus activities and events to their standard programs. For example, Joshua's Place would like to have a vegetable garden, dances, and field trips for its residents. These are great opportunities for volunteers to do something they enjoy. They're also great ways to build friendships.
