[Joshua's Place][1] snippet goes here.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Founder of Joshua's Place, Bob Worgul.

## Origin Story



## Big Wins

When the property for building Joshua's Place was purchased, the lot across the street came as a packaged deal. The lot cost $13,000, but Bob was able to sell it for $125,000. Joshua's Place has also received several large contributions including two of $100,000 or more. One supporter even promised to match up to $500,000 in donations!

The amazing support received so far has helped Joshua's Place reach the amount needed to begin building, but they are still shy of their $1 million goal.

## Today

Six residents will call Joshua's Place home. Each tenant will have their own living quarters and a great room will be used for group activities. The estate will also have several gardens, walkways, and a basketball court that residents can use. Residents will be encouraged to live as independently as possible with some self care expected, but trained personnel will be available around the clock to oversee medication, prepare meals, and provide additional care as needed.

Christian values have been important to Bob while raising Andy and he knows how important church is to Andy. Joshua's Place is open to people of all religions and if a resident wishes, employees will help make arrangements with their place of worship so that they may continue attending.

The facilities will be able to accommodate six adult men with development disabilities. If plans go as expected, residents should be able to move into Joshua's Place in the spring of 2017.

## Goals

Bob already has plans to expand Joshua's Place. In fact, the building has been designed with expansion in mind and can be easily built out to accommodate up to fourteen residents! The additional space and staff would also allow Joshua's Place to care for women with developmental disabilities.

## For Nonprofits

If you want to do something to help a loved one, see what's already available before trying to build something of your own. If you don't find a perfect fit somewhere else, look at ways to get support from organizations that offer services you will need.

Food banks, health foundations, and clothing donation services are just a few examples of charities that you can collaborate with. Let them do what they're best at for you so you can focus on your mission.

## For Volunteers

Many charities like to add fun, bonus activities and events to their standard programs. For example, Joshua's Place would like to have a vegetable garden, dances, and field trips for its residents. These are great opportunities for volunteers to do something they enjoy. They're also great ways to build friendships.
