    IRS Publication 557 has been devoured, a path has been paved, and the first
    few steps have been taken! Read about that and other successes, lessons
    learned, who helped, and what's coming soon in this new progress report.

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully, you will find this progress report informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Joshua's Place][8].
2. Read [IRS Publication 557][12].
3. Wrote Board of Directors Resolution [template][13].
4. Wrote [Conflict of Interest Policy][14].

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Forming a tax-exempt nonprofit with the government is a very serial process.
* Just because a website looks well-organized, doesn't mean it is.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to [UnoDeuce Multimedia][11] for providing the great video in our Joshua's Place spotlight. We're really excited to have [Teresa Potts][15] on our board too. We should be finalizing this soon!

Thank you to all of our new friends on social media:

* 21 mailing list members (+1)
* 59 Twitter followers (+3)
* 74 Facebook page likes (+3)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Spotlight [Williamston Theatre][9].
* Interview [The Davies Project][10].
* Submit Articles of Incorporation.
* Writing Bylaws.

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
