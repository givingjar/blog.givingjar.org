[Williamston Theatre][1] 

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Development Director of Williamston Theatre, Emily Sutton-Smith.

## Origin Story

The Williamston Theatre was founded  by John Lepard, Tony Caselli, Chris Purchis, and Emily Sutton-Smith. John had moved back to Williamston from Los Angeles to raise his daughter and be close to family. While he was working at [The Purple Rose][6] with Tony, Chris, and Emily, he learned that the [Boarshead Theatre][7] had passed up an opportunity to move to Williamston.

John thought the decision was peculiar because Williamston has many of the qualities a small theatre company should love: it's walkable, it has a scenic downtown, and there are plenty of great restaurants and sweet shops for visitors. The idea of opening a nonprofit theatre in Williamston stuck with John. He spent some time kicking the idea around with Tony and asked Chris and Emily for their help as well.

Much of 2005 was spent formalizing their business plan and procuring space for the theatre in downtown Williamston. A huge volunteer effort was organized to remodel the building, which was previously used for retail space.

Williamston Theatre opened their doors to the public with their production of *[Additional Particulars][8]*, a comedy by Ed Simpson, in the summer of 2006.

## Big Wins

Compassionate experiences are not just part of Williamston Theatre's art they are also something cultivated by the theatre's supporters. When one of the theatre's directors was hospitalized, the theatre created a fundraiser to cover additional driving expenses, but when the fundraiser ended, the community had raised enough money to cover most of the medical expenses! Those personal connections are some of the theatre's greatest rewards.

In 2014, the Williamston Theatre was honored with a National Theatre Company Award. The [American Theatre Wing][5] &mdash;creator of the Tony Awards&mdash; presents this award to the twelve most promising theatre companies across the country. This award further demonstrates the high level of commitment Williamston Theatre has to its mission and supporters.

## Today



## Goals

By the end of the summer, Williamston Theatre would like to complete an anthology of fourteen plays with world premieres at their theatre. This not only helps other theatres discover new plays they may want to produce, it also helps promote Michigan talent and the Williamston Theatre brand.

Emily would also love to produce more shows in larger markets and build their relationships with the [Theatre Communications Group][4] and [National New Play Network][3]. Their membership with these national organizations will go a long way in supporting the work Michigan professionals and expanding partnerships with production companies all across the country.

The big "pie in the sky" for Williamston Theatre would be to receive a Regional Tony Award. This would require a lot of growth for the theatre and it may take 30 to 40 years, but Emily wants to ensure Williamston Theatre outlives its creators. Making a legacy of the Williamston Theatre would be a great stride toward achieving both goals.

## For Nonprofits

If you want to start a nonprofit, build an awesome team first. Having a well-balanced group of people who work well together as the foundation of your organization will be vital to its success. It's also important to make sure you provide a work environment that encourages collaboration and creativity.

## For Volunteers

Emily says "Come on down!" Volunteering for an organization like Williamston Theatre that hosts performances will let you see the show for free. If you're not sure how to help, try ushering. Stop by the theatre or call if you're interested.
