Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully, you will find this progress report informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Williamston Theatre][8].
2. Wrote [The Davies Project][9] spotlight.
3. Submitted Articles of Incorporation.

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Calendars and reminders don't work if you forget to use them!
* Undocumented behavior in software can be frustrating, but it can also lead to creative work arounds.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks you, [Nick Nauta][11], for introducing me to Pam of The Davies Project and Kiwanis Club of Lansing!

Thank you to all of our new friends on social media:

* 22 mailing list members (+1)
* 59 Twitter followers (-0)
* 75 Facebook page likes (+1)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Spotlight [The Davies Project][9].
