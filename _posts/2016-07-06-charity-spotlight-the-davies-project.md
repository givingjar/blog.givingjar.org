[The Davies Project][1] provides transportation to and from medical appointments for children with serious or long-term illnesses. Ensuring children receive the care they need not only helps improve the health of the children, it can also improve the overall well-being of their families.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of The Davies Project, Pamela Miklavcic.

## Origin Story

## Big Wins

The generosity of donors continues to be a pleasant surprise for Pam. She says there's nothing quite like walking into her office and seeing a $500 check donated by a stranger, but she also knows that The Davies Project has become a part of a lot of positive stories and knows how valuable that can be.

## Goals

Pam has a variety of aspirations for The Davies Project. She'd love to expand the driving program to 50 drivers, offering 50-60 rides per week, and improving their handicap accessibility.

Reaching more families is important, too. This could be accomplished by building relationships with more faith groups and hospitals, deepening existing relationships, and offering rides to children's primary care or helping women get to their prenatal care. The long-term vision also has The Davies Project branching out to other cities such as Ann Arbor, Flint, and Detroit.

## For Nonprofits

If you help manage a nonprofit, treat it like you're running a marathon and take it one day at a time. Stay true to your mission and always focus on what's most important.

You should also accept that despite their enthusiasm, volunteers are come and go. Don't be afraid to make them a part of your family, but anticipate them moving on someday and always keep your eyes open for additional volunteers.

## For Donors and Volunteers

Whether you want to donate your time, your money, or something else, be realistic about your priorities and give to an organization that is truly important to you. Take a step back from your daily routines and think about what motivates you. Use that to power your decisions.
