    We presented our vision for online giving to another local group dedicated
    to charity in Lansing. Read about that and other successes, lessons learned,
    who helped, and what's coming soon in this new progress report.

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully, you will find this progress report informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [The Davies Project][8].
2. Toured and interviewed [Hospice of Lansing][9].
3. Held organizational board meeting.
4. Giving Jar has an EIN!

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Less is more. Especially when it comes to paperwork and getting signatures from people.
* Low-tech? Try no-tech. Make slides, but use them as your notes and keep your audience focused on you.

## Thanks {#thanks}

The visuals didn't work out when presenting Giving Jar to the [Kiwanis Club of Lansing][10], but we rolled with it and the roundtable presentation worked out even better. Thanks for letting me share Giving Jar's vision with your great group!

Thanks to Chris, Klein, and Teresa, for believing in our mission. After we revolutionize online giving, the Internet will never be the same!

Thank you to our new friends on social media:

* 22 mailing list members (-0)
* 59 Twitter followers (-0)
* 78 Facebook page likes (+3)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Spotlight [Hospice of Lansing][9].
* Applying for 501(c)(3) status.
* Defining the Giving Jar API v1.

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
