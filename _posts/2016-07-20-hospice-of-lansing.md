[Hospice of Lansing][1] is everything a person might want at the end of their life: family, friends, home, comfort, care, love, great memories, peace. Through compassionate hospice care, they help put the focus back on the quality of life.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Fund Development Director, Heather Vida, and the Executive Director, John Person.

## For Nonprofits

If there's something you are passionate about, try to find someone already doing that before you start something new. The energy and love you give to an existing organization could change lives and will likely make a bigger difference than going alone. Working as a team is a great way to achieve a goal.

## For Donors and Volunteers

When it comes to supporting a nonprofit, Heather says "no gift is too small and no volunteer time span is too short." No matter how you choose to help, it will always go a long way. You just have to take that first step and reach out to the people you want to support.
