    We applied for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status and it was a lot easier than one
    might expect! Read about that and other successes, lessons learned, who
    helped, and what's coming soon in this new progress report.

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully, you will find this progress report informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Hospice of Lansing][8].
2. Applied for 501(c)(3) online.
3. Opened a checking account!
4. More software design work.

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Sometimes thinking interferes with doing. Don't overthink.
* In software, there's no such thing as a perfect solution.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to everyone who's sharing our spotlights on social media! We had record-level highs for people reached, people engaged, and clicks these past two weeks. Keep spreading the word!

Thank you to our new friends on social media:

* 23 mailing list members (+1)
* 60 Twitter followers (+1)
* 78 Facebook page likes (-0)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Interview [Origami Brain Injury Rehabilitation Center][9].
* Interview [Hannah's House][10].
* Vacay! But have no fear, the next spotlight will arrive on time!

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
