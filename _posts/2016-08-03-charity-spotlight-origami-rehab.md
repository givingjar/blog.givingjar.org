[Origami Brain Injury Rehabilitation Center][1] provides

Brain trauma is unlike any physical injury a person can experience. 

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with Origami's Executive Director, Tammy Hannah, and Business Development Manager, Yvonne Fleener.

## Big Wins

By increasing the number of people who can be treated at any given time, adding new methods of treatment, and bringing in additional staff, Origami has been able to help many more people than they could nearly twenty years ago.

In fact, Origami recently started working with their 1,000th client! Helping so many people&mdash;and their family&mdash;has been and will continue to be a very uplifting accomplishment.

## Goals

Tammy and Yvonne agree that one of their ongoing goals is to raise awareness about brain injuries, their prevention, and the treatments that Origami provides. Origami has also recently completed the first of five phases to develop and take full advantage of the naturally enriching environment that surrounds them.

## For Nonprofits

Make sure everything you do for a nonprofit is in support of their mission and let that mission guide every decision you make. Teaming up with other nonprofits is also a great way to do a lot of good while still allowing you to focus on your strengths.

## For Donors and Volunteers

When you're deciding where to direct your energy, listen to the stories about who the charity has helped, witness a charity's purpose first-hand, and pick what feels right.

As you volunteer, create your own stories. Support a person, be their cheerleader and their friend. You'll make a huge difference in someone's life.
