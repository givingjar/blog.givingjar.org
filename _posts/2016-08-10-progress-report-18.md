    Our software hasn't even launched and we already have more ideas to help
    raise funds for Lansing charities! Read about that and other successes,
    lessons learned, who helped, and what's coming soon in this new progress
    report.

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully, you will find this progress report informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Origami Brain Injury Rehabilitation Center][8].
2. Got our 501(c)(3) designation!
3. Did all weekly tasks remotely.

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Vacations are great opportunity to become inspired.
* Vacations are a great way to feel anxious about not getting enough done!

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thank you to all of our recent interviewees (Tammy, Yvonne, Jessica, and Deanna) for putting in 2+ hours of interviews. We hope the extra time comes through in our spotlights!

Thank you to our new friends on social media:

* 23 mailing list members (-0)
* 64 Twitter followers (+4)
* 77 Facebook page likes (-1)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Spotlight [Hannah's House][9].
* Apply for [PayPal Giving Fund][10].
* Write a guest blog for [UnoDeuce][11].
* Try really hard to write some code.

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
