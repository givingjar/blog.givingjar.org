Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully, you will find this progress report informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Hannah's House][8].
2. Made a primitive version of the donation extension!
3. Enrolled in [PayPal Giving Fund][9]!

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Sometimes all it takes to be creative is a third party locking down features that you relied on remaining open to the public.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to all theÂ tech companies that make it quick and easy to start using your "For Nonprofits" programs!

Thank you to our new friends on social media:

* 23 mailing list members (-0)
* 63 Twitter followers (-1)
* 80 Facebook page likes (+3)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Scheduling charity interviews.
* Putting the extension in the Chrome store.

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
