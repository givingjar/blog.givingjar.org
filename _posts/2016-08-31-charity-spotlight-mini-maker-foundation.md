[The Mini Maker Foundation][1] makes technologies such as 3D printing accessible to kids and their teachers. These new tools, and the skills that come with them, empower children to create and be creative, two skills that are vital to their future.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Treasurer of The Mini Maker Foundation, Chris Allen.

## Origin Story

## Today



## Big Wins

Starting a nonprofit and receiving the coveted 501(c)(3) designation are pretty big accomplishments and The Mini Maker Foundation accomplished both this year. Shortly thereafter, they also hosted their very first fundraiser.

The Mini Maker Foundation has already helped their first round of teachers, too. Both [East Lansing High School][3] and [Life Tech Academy][4] have received 3D printers. They have also helped [Perry High School][5] with the printer they purchased just before the foundation was established.

## Goals

By the end of the year, The Mini Maker Foundation would love to have donated ten 3D printers to local schools. Building and calibrating each printer takes time, though, as does training teachers and working with them to develop new curriculums.

Thinking long term, the foundation would eventually like to help schools and children all across Michigan. And while a state-wide program may be a ways off, larger school districts such as those in Detroit aren't necessarily too far out of reach.

## For Nonprofits

When it comes to writing grants, Chris recommends approaching it as a marketing challenge: tell your story in a way that makes an emotional connection. Grant writing is a daunting and time-consuming activity, but it doesn't have to be complicated. Just make sure you research a variety of grantors and write to the ones who best align with your mission.

## For Donors and Volunteers

Whether you want to donate your time or your money to a nonprofit, make sure you know what the organization does and it's something you absolutely love. After all, it's your time and money that you're giving away, so make sure it's going to a cause you believe in.
