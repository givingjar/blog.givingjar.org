[The Mini Maker Foundation][1] makes technologies such as 3D printing accessible to kids and their teachers. These new tools, and the skills that come with them, empower children to create and be creative, two skills that are vital to their future.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Treasurer of The Mini Maker Foundation, Chris Allen.

## For Nonprofits

When it comes to writing grants, Chris recommends approaching it as a marketing challenge: tell your story in a way that makes an emotional connection. Grant writing is a daunting and time-consuming activity, but it doesn't have to be complicated. Just make sure you research a variety of grantors and write to the ones who best align with your mission.

## For Donors and Volunteers

Whether you want to donate your time or your money to a nonprofit, make sure you know what the organization does and it's something you absolutely love. After all, it's your time and money that you're giving away, so make sure it's going to a cause you believe in.
