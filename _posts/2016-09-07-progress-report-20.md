Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Hopefully, you will find this progress report informative. As always, all [feedback][5] is welcome!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [The Mini Maker Foundation][8].
2. Put the [PayPal Shopper][9] extension in the Chrome store!
3. Interviewed [R.J. Scheffel Memorial Toy Project][10].

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Work-life balance is still a thing, even in a nonprofit.
* Even the tiniest of apps can have a lot of UX considerations.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to all of our fans who have tried the extension already and given great feedback! [Ian][11], we appreciate the photos you've been taking for us recently!

Thank you to our new friends on social media:

* 25 mailing list members (+2)
* 66 Twitter followers (+3)
* 84 Facebook page likes (+4)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Scheduling charity interviews.
* Let PayPal Shopper users pick a charity.
* Get more spotlighted charities on [PayPal Giving Fund][12].

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
