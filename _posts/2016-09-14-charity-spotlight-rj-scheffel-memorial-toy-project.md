[R.J. Scheffel Memorial Toy Project][1] makes handcrafted wooden toys and donates them to children in need. Whether homeless, in poverty, sick, or otherwise disadvantaged, every child deserves to smile and play.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with a few of R.J. Scheffel Memorial Toy Project's elves: Larry Koster, Gene Klco, Joe Pohl, and Tony Bauer.

## Big Wins

The Scheffel Toy Project has made more than 100,000 toys over the past fifteen years! The all-volunteer organization also prides themselves in helping thousands of kids each year without charging for their toys. Those kinds of numbers also quell any thoughts that wooden toys are a thing of the past.

## Goals

The project's wish list of toys has been steadily increasing. Ten years ago, the group made 6,000 toys in a year. This year, the project received their biggest wish list to date. It has well over 10,000 toys on it! The organization can't promise that they'll be able to supply that many toys, but they are definitely going to try.

## For Nonprofits

When you establish a nonprofit, pick a single mission and focus solely on that. Tony also recommends making that mission clear to volunteers and anyone else working with your organization. The stronger you can connect people to your cause and show them the impact they are making, the more dedication you will receive.

## For Volunteers

If your volunteer time is limited to during the week, weekend, or even seasonally, make sure you discuss your schedule with a nonprofit before you start. Having this talk up front will let you know how flexible they can be with your time. It also gives the nonprofit an idea of how much support they have and need from volunteers.

Volunteer work is also more enjoyable when everyone is friends. If you want to help boost that camaraderie, bring your best attitude, take breaks with other volunteers, and avoid talking about hot topics like politics and religion.
