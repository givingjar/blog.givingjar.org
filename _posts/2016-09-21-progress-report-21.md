Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Have an idea or request? [Tell us][5] about it!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [R.J. Scheffel Memorial Toy Project][8].
2. Great headway on next version of [Shopper][9] extension.
3. Contacted [every spotlighted charity][10] about applying for PayPal Giving Fund.
4. Amazon will now make a donation to Giving Jar if you [select us][14] and shop at [smile.amazon.com][15]!

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Register your business with [Google][12] and [Bing][13] for free, easy SEO.
* When you have a big idea, write down everything about it or risk forgetting important details.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to all of the amazing charities we've covered for sharing your stories and being a part of what we do. We may have small budgets, but we can have a big impact when we work together!

Thank you to our new friends on social media:

* 26 mailing list members (+1)
* 66 Twitter followers (-0)
* 89 Facebook page likes (+5)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Share spotlighted charity fundraisers on social media.
* Schedule charity interviews.
* Let PayPal Shopper users pick a charity.
* Get more spotlighted charities on [PayPal Giving Fund][12].

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
