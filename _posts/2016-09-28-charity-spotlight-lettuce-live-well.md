[Lettuce Live Well][1] guides people toward healthy lifestyles by providing free nutritional and fitness education. Regardless of age or budget, anyone can make healthy improvements to their life and everyone should have the knowledge to do so.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the President of Lettuce Live Well, Kelly Zielinski.

## For Nonprofits

Before you start a business, make sure you understand why a nonprofit is right for your vision. If you don't want to put a price tag on the product or service you're offering, you're heading down the right path!

When you're running a nonprofit, be passionate, be persistent, and be open to change. These are all invaluable qualities to ensure your success.

## For Volunteers

When you're looking for volunteer opportunities, Kelly suggests trying something that you can't find anywhere else. Really own what you do and no matter what role you're filling, consider yourself a leader. Get your hands dirty, work with the public, and be persistent. Accept failure (it happens), learn from it, and always be trying new things.
