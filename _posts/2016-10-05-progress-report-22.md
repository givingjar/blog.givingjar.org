Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Have an idea or request? [Tell us][5] about it!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Lettuce Live Well][8].
2. Helped many charities we've [spotlighted][9] apply for PayPal Giving Fund.
3. Registered (sort of) for [eBay for Charities][10].

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Charities are busy in the fall, as are organizations that do business with charities. Be mindful of their time and schedule time with them well in advance.
* If you're making something for the world, release it early, improve on it often, and when external factors cause you to slow down, use your momentum to always keep moving forward.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to everyone waiting patiently for their PayPal Giving Fund accounts. Lansing charities aren't the only ones joining their program to get more out of online donations!

Thank you to our new friends on social media:

* 27 mailing list members (+1)
* 65 Twitter followers (-1)
* 92 Facebook page likes (+3)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Interview more charities.
* A [Shopper][11] extension that lets you pick a charity.
* [#GivingTuesday][12] planning.
* Attend an [AFP Capital Area][13] meeting.

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
