    We're refocusing on Greater Lansing charities and looking to help a few
    families this winter! Read about that and more in our latest progress
    report.

Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Have an idea? [Tell us][5] about it!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Spotlighted [Nottinghame Nature Nook][8].
2. Kick-off meeting for [Backwards Burglar][9].
3. Attended [Capital Area AFP][10] meeting.

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here are some lessons learned in the past two weeks:

* Allot time wisely and reassess how it's being spent regularly to stay focused on what's really important.
* Right now, Giving Jar is focusing on Greater Lansing charities and changing our Facebook and Twitter posts to reflect this!

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thank you, [Michigan Creative][11], for reaching out to us and organizing the Backwards Burglar event. We also appreciate Heather Vida of [Hospice of Lansing][12] for the invitation to the Capital Area AFP meeting!

Thank you to all our new friends!

* 28 mailing list members (+1)
* 66 Twitter followers (+1)
* 92 Facebook page likes (-0)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Spotlight [Keys to Creativity][13].
* Getting to the bottom of [PayPal Giving Fund's][14] slow onboarding process.
* Releasing the next version of our software!

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
