[Keys to Creativity][1] helps people cross the threshold of art awareness by promoting local artists in public places. In addition to their galleries in the Lansing Mall, they also offer art classes, special events, and the means to recreate their public displays of art in new cities.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of Keys to Creativity, Larry Grudt.

## Big Wins

Opening the Event Gallery, their second space in the Lansing Mall, was a big deal. It's a robust space that can be used to showcase art from a variety of themes and artists and it can be used to host meetings and events. More frontage at the mall also means more people can be exposed to art.

The musical events and benefits have also been a boon to Keys to Creativity. Each event has had higher attendance than the previous one. Their recent event, _The Golden Age of Album Art_, attracted over 500 people from Lansing and across Michigan!

## Goals

Larry would like to improve the electrical and ventilation of their classroom so they can incorporate new mediums and art forms. The organization would also like to host even larger events outside the mall and introduce even more passersby to Lansing art.

Beyond that, Larry would like to organize a [TEDx][7]-like event with topics revolving around art and fun, artistic fillers between presentations. He'd also love to see Lansing nonprofits with intersecting themes unite and hold group fundraiser with shark talks about how they each pursue their related goal.

## For Nonprofits

When you work at a nonprofit, be honest about your goals and open about your needs. Try not to think of other nonprofits as your competition, either. Instead, collaborate with them and connect more people to what you're all doing. You'll grow and accomplish a lot more that way!

## For Donors and Volunteers

Larry encourages donors and volunteers to reflect on the good they are doing from time to time. Whether you donate your time or your money, you are helping your community grow. That may not be easy to see if you set aside the incentives that some organizations offer, but trust that when you help, everyone does benefit from your giving.
