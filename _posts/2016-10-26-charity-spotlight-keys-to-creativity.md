[Keys to Creativity][1] helps people cross the threshold of art awareness by promoting local artists in public places. In addition to their galleries in the Lansing Mall, they also offer art classes, special events, and the means to recreate their public displays of art in new cities.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of Keys to Creativity, Larry Grudt.

## For Nonprofits

When you work at a nonprofit, be honest about your goals and open about your needs. Try not to think of other nonprofits as your competition, either. Instead, collaborate with them and connect more people to what you're all doing. You'll grow and accomplish a lot more that way!

## For Donors and Volunteers

Larry encourages donors and volunteers to reflect on the good they are doing from time to time. Whether you donate your time or your money, you are helping your community grow. That may not be easy to see if you set aside the incentives that some organizations offer, but trust that when you help, everyone does benefit from your giving.
