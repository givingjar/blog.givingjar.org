Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Have an idea? [Tell us][5] about it!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Help your favorite charity win a free promotional video in our [Giving Tuesday Video Giveaway][11]!
2. Spotlighted [Greater Lansing Food Bank][9].
3. Added Greater Lansing Food Bank to our [Shopper software][8]!
4. Interviewed [Voiceless-MI][10].

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here's what we learned recently:

* Creating a website for all screen sizes is 10% coding, 40% troubleshooting, and 50% testing.
* Being anxious doesn't get more work done. Usually, the opposite is true.

## Thanks {#thanks}

Thanks to Heather Vida of [Hospice of Lansing][13] for the invitation to the recent [AFP Capital Area][12] presentation. Thanks to Paul Schmidt of [UnoDeuce Multimedia][14] for including us in the Giving Tuesday Video Giveaway.

Thank you to all our new friends!

* 33 mailing list members (+5)
* 67 Twitter followers (+2)
* 98 Facebook page likes (+4)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Present [Backwards Burglar][15] at [SoupGrant Lansing][16].
* Spotlight [Voiceless-MI][10].
* Interview [Child and Family Charities][17].

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
