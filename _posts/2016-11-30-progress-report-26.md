Progress reports are Giving Jar's way of celebrating *[Success][1]*, learning from *[Failure][2]*, giving *[Thanks][3]*, and taking a peek at what's *[Up and Coming][4]*. Have an idea? [Tell us][5] about it!

## Success {#success}

Here are the major wins in this progress report:

1. Started the [Backwards Burglar][11] fundraiser. Donate and help a Lansing family in need!
2. Wrapped up the Video Giveaway. Congrats to [Cristo Rey Community Center][12]!
3. Spotlighted [Voiceless-MI][9].
4. Added Origami and Voiceless-MI to our [Shopper software][8]!

## Failure {#failure}

Failure is okay if you learn from it. Here's what we learned recently:

* Once again, we're surprised by how long it takes for a tech company to verify a nonprofit.
* Persistence pays! After months of work, we're finally on [Humble Bundle][13]!

## Thanks {#thanks}

Our open rate is consistently over 30%, which is astounding. We _really_Â appreciate you learning and growing with us!

Twenty-eight nonprofits were nominated in our video giveaway. You all rock!

Thank you to all our new friends!

* 33 mailing list members (-0)
* 69 Twitter followers (+2)
* 99 Facebook page likes (+1)

## Upcoming {#upcoming}

Here's where the focus will be in the next two weeks at Giving Jar:

* Default to $1 donations with the Shopper extension.
* Interview [Child and Family Charities][10].

We are always looking for charities in the Greater Lansing area to write about. If you know of one, [email us][5], [tweet][6], or write on our [Facebook][7] wall.
