[Child and Family Charities][1] helps children across Michigan be carefree and form healthy bonds with their families. They do this by offering a wealth of services that aid children, strengthen families, and help them break free of harmful patterns.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of Child and Family Charities, Julie Thomasma.

## Big Wins

Child and Family Charities works with more than 6,000 kids every year. It's wonderful to help so many children and be a provider for their families and homes. Each child helped is a very special reward.

Helping so many kids also requires a lot of adaptation. The organization is also wrapping up its most recent focus groups and developing a new strategic plan to better serve the families of Michigan.

## Goals

There is a challenge that comes with regularly adjusting to the needs of families. Julie and the rest of Child and Family Charities must also provide a consistent message to the community and keep them updated as their services. This will be an especially important goal as they roll out their new plan.

Family is important at Child and Family Charities, and that includes their own. Their new plan includes additional ways to take care of their staff such as training, secondary trauma support, and any other resources that aid them in helping others.

## For Donors

Cash may not seem like an attractive way to give, but it is extraordinarily helpful to nonprofits. A cash donation can fill any gap or need the organization may have and helps a nonprofit go above and beyond government services.  When you donate cash, it also shows that you trust the organization to spend your money wisely.

## For Nonprofits

Many of the staff at Child and Family Charities have been there more than ten years. It's great to have your staff become part of the family like that, so take care of them like family! Listen to them, treat them with respect, and change with their needs just as you would with anyone else you help.

Julie also points out the importance of being sensitive to secondary trauma. People are vulnerable when they help others and your staff will be affected by their work. Give them time and help them heal.
