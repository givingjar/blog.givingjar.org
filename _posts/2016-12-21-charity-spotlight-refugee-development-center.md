[Refugee Development Center][1] helps refugees become independent members of society by teaching English as a second language, organizing social activities for kids and adults, and forming lasting, supportive relationships.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of Refugee Development Center, Erika Brown-Binion.

## Big Wins

Refugee Development Center was able to withstand the recent economic downturn. Erika even saw an outpouring of support from volunteers during this time, and that's not all. RDC has also improved their outreach efforts to better help the public understand who refugees are.

The center also moved into a new building recently. The new space has allowed RDC to reach more people in part due to its location.

## Goals

RDC's new facility also opens up more opportunities for the organization. Erika would love to double the English as a second language program and add a drop-in center where refugees can receive mentorship and one-on-one support.

A mobile computer lab would also provide refugees with access to technology to help improve English literacy and further remove transportation barriers.

## For Nonprofits

When you work for a nonprofit, you have to be flexible. Be willing to reflect on and accept change; it will make your work that much easier. Erika finds this advice to be useful in a lot of domains, and it's especially true in nonprofits.

Erika also points out that the more deeply you get involved with a nonprofit, the more challenging the work will be. Make sure you believe in the mission and have a passion for what you are doing.

## For Volunteers

Everyone at Refugee Development Center started out as a volunteer. Coming back to passion, Erika recommends volunteering as a great way to discover it. You may have to volunteer at a lot of different places before you find something you care so deeply about, but when you do, you will be strengthened by it.
