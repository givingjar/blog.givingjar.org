[REACH Studio Art Center][1] runs educational art programs that are affordable and close to Lansing residents. By exposing more people to art and creativity, REACH helps enrich lives and bring communities together.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of REACH Studio Art Center, Alice Brinkman.

## Origin Story

While teaching an after-school program at Moores Park School, Alice noticed that there were very few art classes offered outside of regular school hours. The art classes that were offered did not tend to be economical or at a convenient location for many of the residents of Lansing.

Alice thought that art shouldn't only be available to those who can pay for it. This idea became a dream that she would hold onto for years while she connected with the community to find a studio space at an accessible location where she could offer affordable art classes.

The first classes were offered in a building close to downtown in 2003. It's one large classroom offered art programs for ages ranging from toddlers to adults and using many materials including clay and fiber.

## Today

In 2013, [REACH][1] expanded into the surrounding five buildings. They offer a wealth of [classes][11] to all ages and make sure classes are affordable for anyone who might want to attend.

[Adults][13] can learn a variety of clay, drawing, and painting techniques through the studio's adult clay, _Picture This_, and _Mud &amp; Mug_ classes. Similarly, [kids][14] as young as age two can find clay, drawing, and painting classes that fit their skill level.

The center offers art exploration classes, a K-3 summer school program, and an [open studio][9] for teens. REACH also has a Late State Wednesday program to Lansing School District students and programs for [homeschoolers][12].

The studio also features the works of local artists in their gallery, hosts special events, and participates in a variety of community events. Their art truck helps improve exposure to art by traveling to other locations across Lansing.

## Big Wins

REACH's expansion has been a great boon to their mission. More classes can be held simultaneously, which means the studio can reach even more people than ever. Working with the [Lansing School District][7] has also helped expose art to more kids.

The [Teen Open Studio's][9] _Community Art Projects_ helps teens work with local businesses to create public art exhibits and has had a wonderful impact on the community. You've probably even seen some of these [exhibits][8]!

## Goals

The art center has only completed some of the renovations in their [facility expansion project][10], leaving them plenty of room to grow. As new wings are completed, REACH will explore new possibilities with those spaces, including a fiber arts studio, digital media lab, and a performing arts studio.

## For Nonprofits

> "If you think that you want to continue doing your own art, think twice."

This was the advice Alice received from her mentor, Carol Rose. Alice explains that when you find something important enough to open up opportunities for others, it may close some for you.

Operating a nonprofit is challenging and it's easy to get burnt out. Starting a nonprofit takes a lot of growth and trust in others. Make sure you're committed.

## For Donors and Volunteers

Nonprofits have to be careful to accept donations and volunteers they know they can use. If an organization can't utilize your time, skills, or specific donation requests, it may cause more work if they accept your time or gift anyway.

You can avoid this by being flexible with your donations. Don't be too specific with your requests or, at the very least, be understanding and patient if your contribution can't be used right away.
