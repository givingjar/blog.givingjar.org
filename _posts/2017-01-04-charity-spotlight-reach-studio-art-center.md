[REACH Studio Art Center][1].

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of REACH Studio Art Center, Alice Brinkman.

## Big Wins

REACH's expansion in 2013 has been a great boon to their mission. More classes can be held simultaneously, which means the studio can reach even more people than ever. Working with the [Lansing School District][7] has also helped expose art to more kids.

The [Teen Open Studio's][9] Community Arts Program helps teens work with local businesses to create public art exhibits and has had a wonderful impact on the community. You've probably even seen some of these [exhibits][8]!

## Goals

The art center has has only completed some of the renovations in their [facility expansion project][10], leaving plenty of room to grow. As new wings are completed, REACH will explore new possibilities with those spaces, including a fiber arts studio, digital media lab, and a performing arts studio.

## For Nonprofits

> "If you think that you want to continue doing your own art, think twice."

This was the advice Alice received from her mentor, Carol Rose. Alice explains that when you find something important enough to open up opportunities for others, it may close some for you.

Operating a nonprofit is challenging and it's easy to get burnt out. Starting a nonprofit takes a lot of growth and trust in others. Make sure you're committed.

## For Donors and Volunteers

Nonprofits have to be careful to accept donations and volunteers they know they can use. If an organization can't utilize your time, skills, or specific donation requests, it may cause more work if they accept your time or gift anyway.

You can avoid this by being flexible with your donations. Don't be too specific with your requests or, at the very least, be understanding and patient if your contribution can't be used right away.
