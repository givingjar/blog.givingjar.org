[Haven House][1].

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of Haven House, Angie Mayeaux.

## Origin Story

Amid the early 1980s recession, Michigan was hit especially hard with high unemployment. By September 1982, unemployment in Michigan reached 14.5%, the highest in the nation.

This high unemployment caused an abrupt increase in the number of people unable to afford homes and food for their families. Members of the Lansing community saw the need for a family shelter and responded by creating one.

For several years, the shelter operated at the [St. John Student Parish][7], offering short-term housing and food to families with or without children. In 1985, the shelter move to a new location in East Lansing and narrowed their focus to families with children.

Today, Haven House continues to serve families in the Lansing area by providing emergency housing while developing each family's self-sufficiency.

## For Nonprofits

The first time you do fundraising for a nonprofit, you might be shy about asking too much or too often of your donors. Angie says that's okay, but it _is_ important to ask. Donors don't know when your support is needed unless you ask. It's also very important to thank them afterward.

When you communicate with your supporters, make sure your message is clear. Set their expectations appropriately. If you're worried that your message is too big or different, ease into it. You don't have to do it all at once. Your supporters will appreciate that.

## For Donors

Many nonprofits are as busy in July as they are in December and in need of just as much support. Holiday giving is wonderful, but if you can, consider donating throughout the year. Your year-round donations can help an organization like Haven House keep kids from having to sleep in a car all year long.
