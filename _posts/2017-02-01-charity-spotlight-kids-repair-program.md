[Kids Repair Program][1] teaches children how to properly own, operate, and maintain a bicycle. Supportive experiences and education empower children while helping them develop healthy habits and a positive attitude that can last a lifetime.

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Director of Kids Repair Program, Jeanne Pearl-Wright.

## For Nonprofits

Your nonprofit will rely on others for support and your budget will demand it, so it will be extremely beneficial for you to get comfortable working with the public! Don't be afraid to reach out to the community&mdash;in any medium&mdash;to seek help.

When you do reach out for help, whether your looking for volunteers or donations, Jeanne recommends keeping your message simple. Make it clear and make it encouraging. Go ahead and take "can't" out of your dictionary, too.

## For Volunteers

Organizations that rely on volunteers usually have a to-do list that's a mile long. If you've found someplace that you want to help, don't worry that they might not need your help, because they definitely do.

If you are a leader in a nonprofit, Jeanne also has recommendations to make it easy to support your volunteers: write your to-do list down and let volunteers pick from it. It's a great way to empower your volunteers and it shows that you really do have a need their help!
