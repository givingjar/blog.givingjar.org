[Lansing Symphony Orchestra][1].

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of Lansing Symphony Orchestra, Courtney Millbrook.

## Origin Story

## Big Wins

Strong community collaboration continues to be a great way for LSO to reach new people and venues. Fresh programming also helps them reach new audiences and grow their overall profile while keeping existing patrons happy.

Courtney is also proud of the great strides they have made toward growing their budget and chipping away at debt.

## Goals

Lansing Symphony Orchestra would love to introduce more types of programs, new performers, and full family concerts. They would also like to revisit and resume programs from their past that are no longer running.

In order to achieve those goals, LSO would like to eliminate any long-term debt, build a stronger endowment, and raise funds that can be used as risk capital.

## For Nonprofits

Funding and audience/donor engagement are two challenges you will always face in a nonprofit. Courtney offers several pieces of advice to help tackle them: be clear about who your organization is, avoid mission creep, and focus on your strengths.

Don't always pursue opportunities for money, either. Be willing to pass on grants and other forms of funding if they don't align with your mission and values. It will help you focus on what's important.

## For Volunteers and Patrons

_How_ you help an organization will change over time. Courtney recommends finding something you absolutely love and are willing to support _however_ you can.

Being a reliable and consistent volunteer is an especially meaningful way to help&mdash;you will always make a nonprofit smile! ðŸ™‚
