## For Nonprofits

Funding and audience/donor engagement are two challenges you will always face in a nonprofit. Courtney offers several pieces of advice to help tackle them: be clear about who your organization is, avoid mission creep, and focus on your strengths.

Don't always pursue opportunities for money, either. Be willing to pass on grants and other forms of funding if they don't align with your mission and values. It will help you focus on what's important.

Courtney adds that this advice can apply to your personal life too!
