[Men Making a Difference][1].

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Founder of Men Making a Difference, Andrew Brewer Jr.

## Big Wins



## Goals

Every new family MMAD sees at their annual cookout raises at least that much more awareness about diversity and the importance of family and community. The continued success of their festival is an important goal they maintain each year.

Men Making a Difference also wishes to introduce a life mentoring program someday. Mentoring fits very much in line with the virtues they promote, but to formalize a mentorship program they must first overcome the financial barrier of starting it.

## For Nonprofits

The founding members of Men Making a Difference have learned a lot since their first cookout and they continue to learn new things every year. If you're starting a nonprofit, a willingness to learn and adapt will be vital to your success.

It can take a long time to build your nonprofit's momentum, so stay committed to your cause, keep an open mind, and listen to other peoples' ideas. Taking the time to develop these skills will help your organization persevere.

## For Volunteers

Volunteerism within one's community is an important tenet at Men Making a Difference and every event they host demonstrates positive volunteer experiences. If you're considering donating your time to someone, Mr. Brewer has this fundamental piece of advice for you to keep in mind: don't overburden yourself. Volunteering should make you feel good, not angry!
