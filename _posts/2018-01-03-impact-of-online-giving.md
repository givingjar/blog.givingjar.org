In 2017, we started focusing on helping Lansing nonprofits enroll in online fundraising tools such as Facebook's and PayPal Giving Fund. Now that the year is over, we'd like to share a success story about how these tools can be used to collect more donations and further pursue your mission.

## New Love for Woodland Friends

[Nottingham Nature Nook][1] is a wildlife rehabilitation and education center in East Lansing. We started helping them register for both PayPal Giving Fund and Facebook's fundraising tools in January (they have similar requirements, so why not). The process is tedious, to put it nicely, and there's almost always a hiccup along the way. Much coffee was consumed.

Come February, Nottingham Nature Nook had a donate button on their Facebook page. We finished setting up PayPal Giving Fund in March. Each one only took a few hours of our time, but the charity verification process requires a lot of waiting and a little troubleshooting. Fortunately, you only have to enroll once.

Nottingham Nature Nook's supporters started using the donate buttons almost immediately. By the end of the year, donors had contributed $370 on PayPal and $570 on Facebook. Nottingham Nature Nook also ran their first Giving Tuesday fundraiser on Facebook. From that, they raised an additional $3,500.

That's more than $4,400 raised online last year. A lot of kids and animals can be helped with that kind of support!

## Let's Get You Enrolling

With Facebook [eliminating donation fees][2] this year, online giving using social media is going to explode. But signing up for fundraising tools like Facebook's and PayPal's can be a little tricky. That's where we can help.

If your nonprofit is the self-service type, start enrolling now (check out our [guide for PayPal Giving Fund][4] for some pro tips). If you encounter problems or would rather focus on your mission while someone else does the techie stuff, [email us][3] to schedule a call or meeting. Our services are always free to nonprofits in Greater Lansing.

We love all the good you're doing in Lansing and dread the idea that technology may be a barrier to you. That's why our mission is to help you explore new ways to raise funds online and spread the word about what you do.

We wish you the best in 2018 and look forward to talking to you soon!
