[Able Eyes][1].

In this charity spotlight, I spoke with the Executive Director of Able Eyes, Meegan Winters.

## Origin Story

In 2011, Meegan taught children with autism spectrum disorder through the Jackson County Intermediate School District. At an education conference in Chicago, she met a CEO who created online digital tours known as WebWalks to help people with disabilities explore real world spaces without leaving their home.

Meegan saw a lot of potential in this technology to help people on the autism spectrum experience new and unknown places before venturing there in person. Unfortunately, this particular opportunity from her conference visit didn't work out &mdash; but the idea stuck.

Years later, in early 2017, a new opportunity arose when she met Brian Town, the CEO of [Michigan Creative][2]. Brian was using similar technologies to help local businesses. This time, Meegan went all-in. She quit her job to focus on helping people with autism learn new skills and explore new places using state-of-the-art technology.

At the end of August, 2017, [Able Eyes][1] was launched, serving not only those with autism, but anyone of any ability level.
